# Flask API - Introduction
Intentify's backend relies on Flask for its API endpoints and models. More details can be found in each respective section.

## Models
Currently, Intentify only uses one model: **User**. This model is created once a user registers an account with a unique email
and a password that is at least 8 characters long. Another model, **Conversation**, was planned to be integrated into this
web application, but was not used due to time constraints.

## Endpoints
Most endpoints interact with Intentify's User model, fulfilling all basic CRUD operations. In a similar way, Intentify's
Conversation model has creation, reading, and delete operations fully implemented, despite not being used by this web application.

The base URL used to access these endpoints http://localhost:4000, or what will be referred to as \{\{NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL}}.
