## Session Information
Upon a successful login, the server sets the following session variables:
- **email**: The authenticated user's email.
- **created_at**: The timestamp when the session was created.
- **expired_at**: The timestamp when the session will expire, calculated as `SESSION_LIFETIME` from the current time.
In Flask's `config.py` file, this value is 7 days (`SESSION_LIFETIME=7`).
