# Endpoints - Introduction
Most endpoints interact with Intentify's User model, fulfilling all basic CRUD operations. In a similar way, Intentify's
Conversation model has creation, reading, and delete operations fully implemented.

The base URL used to access these endpoints locally is http://localhost:4000, 
or what will be referred to as \{\{NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL}}.
