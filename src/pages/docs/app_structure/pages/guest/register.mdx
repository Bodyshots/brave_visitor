# Register
Where unauthenticated users can create an account. Successful registrations automatically login the user and redirect them
to the authenticated home view. Unsuccessful registrations display an error to the user.

Authenticated users cannot go to this page to avoid a single user being able to create multiple accounts while signed in. 

Note: This page's layout was inspired from [Chatsimple's sign-in/registration page](https://app.chatsimple.ai/)!
