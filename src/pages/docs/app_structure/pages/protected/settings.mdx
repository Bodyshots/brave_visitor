The main account customization page.

The following attributes can be modified by users on this page:
- Theme (also modifiable by unauthenticated users)
- First and last names
  - These attributes change how the authenticated home view greets users, using the user's first and last name.
  If only a last name is saved, the authenticated home view's greeting remains generic and unchanged
  - Both of these fields need to be less than 255 characters
- Email
  - The email must be unique and less than 255 characters
- Password
  - The password must be at least 8 characters long, but also less than 255 characters

Unauthenticated users cannot access this page, as they should have no account to edit.
