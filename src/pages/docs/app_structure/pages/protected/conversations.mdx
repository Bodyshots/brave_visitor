# Conversations
A page that keeps track of a user's conversations. A conversation is saved here after the
authenticated user provides their email to the bot and agrees to save it in their list.
Every conversation entry details the date when the conversation started, the URLs explored,
and the predicted occupation and intentions of the user during the specific conversation.
Users can also delete a conversation from their list if they decide to.

A user having no conversations saved will have no list. They must save at least one conversation
to have a conversation list displayed.

## Improvements
The contents of the conversation list can seem squished on smaller resolutions. One solution
could be to redesign a conversation entry to only consist three spaces: the conversation number, an edit button, and
a delete button. The edit button could, then, bring up a modal showing the entry's entire information. This way,
both desktop and mobile users could be able to easily use Intentify without having to worry about
its conversation list seeming crammed.
