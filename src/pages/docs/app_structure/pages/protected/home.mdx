# Home - Authenticated view
The landing page for authenticated users. This view isn't too dissimilar to the home view
for guests, as it still has a video showing users how to use the service.

If the authenticated user has a first name saved, then the home page will use this name
to greet the user. The page will also use their last name to greet the user, given that
they have a first name saved.

The text above the video will change, depending on whether the user has any conversations
saved. If they do, then the text will invite them to begin having a conversation with Intentify's chatbots.
Otherwise, the text will implore the user to have another conversation.
