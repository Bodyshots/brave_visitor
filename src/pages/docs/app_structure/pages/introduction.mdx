# Introduction

Webpages are separated into three groups, depending on a user's level of authorization. Any unauthorized user accessing an
invalid page is redirected to the home page of Intentify with a warning message.

## Public
Any user is able to access these pages, as they offer generalized information about Intentify as a whole.

## Guest
Only users that aren't signed in can access these pages. This prevents signed in users from registering and signing into multiple accounts at once.

## Protected
Signed in users can only access these pages. These pages are interact with a signed in user's account and are specific to each user.
