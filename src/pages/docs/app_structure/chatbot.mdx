# Chatbot
The main functionality of Intentify comes from its embedded chatbot, developed in [Botpress](https://botpress.com/). You can access the bot
by going to [this link](https://cdn.botpress.cloud/webchat/v2.2/shareable.html?configUrl=https://files.bpcontent.cloud/2024/11/26/21/20241126213006-5BKMDW08.json).
You can also download this bot, import it, and interact with it on Botpress by clicking [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19aRvci2Y5_WK3khd3-unct-RKJNP-1f6/view?usp=drive_link).

## Chatbot Embed vs Chatbot Components
From tinkering around with its Botpress's React Components (detailed [here](https://botpress.com/docs/react-js)), Botpress's libraries seem to really dislike
Next.JS, as Botpress's libraries will often bring up compilation errors. My guess is that they have something to do with how Next.js's handles its files and components differently
to React Native (eg. server-side rendering), as using these libraries in React Native don't seem to bring up these errors.
So, especially considering the amount of work needed to style and recode Botpress's chatbot from scratch, I just chose to use the provided embed script provided by Botpress,
rather than forcing myself to use their components.

It's worth noting that, from my testing, explicitly declaring Botpress's files as "use client" did not resolve these errors.

## Saving Conversations
To allow the chatbot to save conversations, the backend server must be accessible via a public URL. Since both the frontend and backend services in this project are served locally, 
you'll need to temporarily expose the backend using ngrok. So, you'll need to do a couple of things:

- An ngrok account to use ngrok's commands (sign up [here](https://ngrok.com/))
- Install "ngrok", which allows you to temporarily expose the server's URL publicly. You can install ngrok [here](https://download.ngrok.com)
- A Botpress account to edit the chatbot

### Configuration
After you've installed ngrok, run Intentify as per usual. Then, run the following command:
```
ngrok http 4000
```
As our backend server is running on port 4000, this command will expose port 4000 on a public URL. Upon running this command, you'll see details about
how the temporary public URL is doing, including its latency and approximate region. The URL you'll need is beside the text that says "Forwarding". If you're
using the free plan, it'll look something like:
```
https://30f3-134-231-35-146.ngrok-free.app (an example, yours may be different)
```
Copy this URL and go edit Intentify's bot in Botpress. Find the node that is labelled "save_convo" and click the third card. It should have a blue thunderbolt
symbol. Click the code popup and replace the value of "baseURL1" with your copied URL. Then, click the "Publish" button on the top right of your screen.

Now, return to your Botpress workspace and go to the Webchat section. Under the Share tab, copy the Embed code of the bot and replace the Script src links of the
ChatEmbed component. The file you'll need to edit is located in components/GlobalComps/ChatEmbed/ChatEmbed.tsx.

If everything is working fine, you should be able to save conversations with Intentify! You'll still access the site using the localhost:3000 destination.
Ensure you keep your ngrok command running while you interact with the
website. If it stops, you'll need to do this entire process again; ngrok generates a different public URL everytime it's launched.

## Improvements
One major improvement that could be made to this chatbot is in regards to security. Currently, it's possible to be an unauthenticated user and add a conversation
to an existing account's conversation list. Counteracting this would ideally involve checking if the user is authenticated. However, as the chatbot is available
globally, updating the chatbot with the user's authenticated state (and email) may be pretty difficult and may require coding the Botpress's bot client
from scratch.

Another improvement is in regards to bot configuration, as editing the bot everytime Intentify is deployed from scratch can be burdensome. This can be
solved by having a static backend server so a service like ngrok is no longer needed (may require having to deal with cross-site cookies for authentication).

Finally, one last improvement is in regards to the URLs the bot can access. As the bot uses jina.ai to analyze URL content, URLs on HTTP are unavailable
to the bot due to security concerns. This could be counteracted by using an alternative method of scanning such web pages (manual webscraping?).
