# Chatbot
The main functionality of Intentify comes from its embedded chatbot, developed in [Botpress](https://botpress.com/). You can access the bot
by going to [this link](https://cdn.botpress.cloud/webchat/v2.2/shareable.html?configUrl=https://files.bpcontent.cloud/2024/11/26/21/20241126213006-5BKMDW08.json).
You can also download this bot and interact with it on Botpress by clicking [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VIziWGD0jWUoUnNVXpXBVkNlxmld7at1/view?usp=sharing).

## Chatbot Embed vs Chatbot Components
From tinkering around with its Botpress's React Components (detailed [here](https://botpress.com/docs/react-js)), Botpress's libraries seem to really dislike
Next.JS, as Botpress's libraries will often bring up compilation errors. My guess is that they have something to do with how Next.js's handles its files and components differently
to React Native (eg. server-side rendering), as using these libraries in React Native don't seem to bring up these errors.
So, especially considering the amount of work needed to style and recode Botpress's chatbot from scratch, I just chose to use the provided embed script provided by Botpress,
rather than forcing myself to use their components.

It's worth noting that, from my testing, explicitly declaring Botpress's files as "use client" did not resolve these errors.

## Improvements
One major improvement that could be made to this chatbot is in regards to security. Currently, it's possible to be an unauthenticated user and add a conversation
to an existing account's conversation list. Counteracting this would ideally involve checking if the user is authenticated. However, as the chatbot is available
globally, updating the chatbot with the user's authenticated state (and email) may be pretty difficult. One alternative is to stylize and code Botpress's bot client
from scratch. Yet, as discussed in "Chatbot Embed vs Chatbot Components", this could also be pretty difficult.
