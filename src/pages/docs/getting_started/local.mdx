# Installing and running locally

## Getting started

First, clone the git repository. Before running the web application, you'll need to
set up a few services and environment variables.

### Environment Variables
Intentify's frontend and backend both require environment variables that need to be set
in a .env file.

#### Frontend (src)
- **NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL**: The location of the Flask server. Set this to http://localhost:4000
- **NEXT_PUBLIC_DB_BASE_URL**: The location of the database. Set this to http://127.0.0.1:5432

#### Backend
- **SECRET_KEY**: A randomly generated secret key for encryption.

### Scripts

Inside, there are four scripts that help you with this web application's lifecycle.

### setup.sh
Sets up and activates the virtual environment "venv" to install the required dependencies
for the backend (requires the installation of Python's venv module).

### setup_docker.sh
Removes any existing docker containers and volumes. Thereafter, the script installs
the necessary frontend dependencies in the virtual environment and rebuilds the web
application's containers.<br/><br/>
The web application depends on three services:
- db - A PostgreSQL database that runs on port 5432
- flaskapp - The Flask backend of the web application, running on port 4000
- nextapp - The Next.JS frontend of the web application, running on port 3000

### run.sh
Runs the web application, utilizing the virtual environment.

### shutdown.sh
Stops all running docker containers.

---
In general, start Intentify by running (in order), setup.sh, setup_docker.sh, and run.sh.
Once done, run shutdown.sh to stop all running services. You don't have to set
the application back up after you stop it; just run run.sh to start it back up.
